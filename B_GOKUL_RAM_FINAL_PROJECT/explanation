About Dataset:

The Telco Customer Churn dataset, imported from the BigQuery table cloud-training-demos.
bqml_accelerator.telco_customer_churn_train, provides data related to customers of a
telecommunications company. The dataset is designed to predict customer churn, which is when customers
stop using the company's services. The data includes various customer attributes,
such as account information, usage metrics, and services used, along with a label indicating
whether the customer churned.

Column Explanations:

    customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer.
    state: The U.S. state in which the customer resides
    account_length: Duration in days that the customer has been with the company.
    area_code: The area code of the customer's phone number.
    international_plan: Whether the customer has an international calling plan (True/False).
    voice_mail_plan: Whether the customer has a voice mail service (True/False).
    number_vmail_messages: Number of voice mail messages the customer has.
    total_day_minutes: Total number of minutes the customer has used during the day.
    total_day_calls: Total number of calls made by the customer during the day.
    total_day_charge: Total charges incurred by the customer for day-time calls.
    total_eve_minutes: Total number of minutes the customer has used during the evening.
    total_eve_calls: Total number of calls made by the customer during the evening.
    total_eve_charge: Total charges incurred by the customer for evening calls.
    total_night_minutes: Total number of minutes the customer has used during the night.
    total_night_calls: Total number of calls made by the customer during the night.
    total_night_charge: Total charges incurred by the customer for night-time calls.
    total_intl_minutes: Total number of minutes the customer has used for international calls.
    total_intl_calls: Total number of international calls made by the customer.
    total_intl_charge: Total charges incurred by the customer for international calls.
    number_customer_service_calls: Number of calls made by the customer to customer service.
    churn: Indicates whether the customer has churned (True/False).

Analyses:

    I done Churn Prediction using Random Forest Classifier models to predict whether a customer
    is likely to churn based on the other features and check accuracy of the model and plotted it

    Segment customers based on their usage patterns and
    identify profiles that are more likely to churn.

    Analyze which features are most predictive of customer churn using Random Frest Feature Importance.

    Analysed customer service call patterns to understand
    if frequent calls are associated with higher churn rates using plots.

    Estimated the lifetime value of customers based on their
    account length and usage to prioritize retention efforts using pandas.

    Studied the impact of having an international plan or a voice mail plan
    on customer retention via statistical models

    Explored patterns in call and usage data to identify
    trends related to churn via statistical models and plots
